# UCSD/HDSI Covid-19 Website

## IMPORTANT
To run this properly, you will need to host this on a server. Opening the HTML in a browser will NOT display the charts properly. Either use VS code "Live Server" extension, `python3 -m http.server 8080` followed by visiting 127.0.0.1:8080 to open a server, or some other server of your choosing.

## TODO Major
We have one of two options: <br> <br>
1. We can manually fetch the information weekly and run the Python script
2. We can create a CRON job? IDK
3. See Below
<br>
<hr>
Right now, in order to convert the data from the supplied CSV to a chart friendly JSON, we need to run `python3 generate.py` (you'll need pandas) in order to generate the df.json file needed. 
<br>
<br>
If you could, can you rewrite *datasets/generate.py* to be in JS entirely instead. Ideally, it will download the latest data from their GitHub, convert with the afformentioned script you can create, and then you can store that to js/map.js . 
<br>
<br>
Next, find a WP plugin or something that will allow us to scheudle a job that runs the JS script daily or weekly or whatever. That would make it a very low maintenence page.
<br>
<br>
Probably want to be in a call to discuss this if wanted, but this can be a down the line thing.

Afterwards, if you wanted to look into the second page, that would be great. Although we might be able to squeeze it onto the first page, but double check the emails.

### TODO Minor

* Add Favicon
* Add About Text

## Technologies Used
* Bootstrap 4
* HighCharts (the licensing seems to be very permissive, but we still need to contact them to get a valid free key)
